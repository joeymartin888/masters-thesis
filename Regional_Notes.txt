Spring Predictability Barrier - Pan-Arctic, May (GIN Seas, Barents, Kara, Laptev, ESI, Chuckchi), April (Beaufort), No Skill until Summer (Hudson Bay and Baffin Bay)

Pan Arctic - two "lobes" around April and September

Lobes in other regions: Bering Sea (March, April), Labrador Sea (February, March), strong skill in all the Barents Sea - less so in GIN

Lower skill than in other models in the Labrador Sea

Dirth of Skill North of Siberia for longer lead times (parabolic)

No Skill outside of September-0 for Central Arctic

Hudson Bay - Highest Skill in the melt (lead 4) and freeze (lead 5) seasons
Baffin Bay - Highest Skill in the melt (lead 4) and freeze (lead 6) seasons

These are past the spring predictability barrier (March)
