Paper Notes:

Woosung authorship for Chapter 3
For the paper you could see if there are consistent climatological biases in Laptev SIE in the operational CanCM4

Idea for the paper (not the thesis): compare the GEM-NEMO skill to that of CanCM3i. Is CanCM3i more skillful on the pan-Arctic scale, or is it the particular combination with CanCM4 (better compensation of errors) that makes CanSIPSv1b better than CanSIPSv2
